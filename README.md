# Dice_app

## The Goal
The objective of this code is to learn a bit about the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps that will be build in the future. This app helps to learn how to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets

## What is this
You can make the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be able to settle any score on the go! You can play all Indian games such as ludo or snakes n ladder too!!!

## What did I Learn
* How to use Flutter stateless widgets to design the user interface.
* How to use Flutter stateful widgets to update the user interface.
* How to change the properties of various widgets.
* How to use onPressed listeners to detect when buttons are pressed.
* How to use setState to mark the widget tree as dirty and requiring update on the next render.
* How to use Expanded to make widgets adapt to screen dimensions.
* Understand and use string interpolation.
* Learn about basic dart programming concepts such as data types and functions.
* Code and use gesture controls.

## 100 Days Challenge
* Day 3: Initially drew the frame work of the app on the stateless widget. Saw how to change the various properties of the widgets.Also learnt a bit about various dart programming techniques.
* Day 4: Used FlatButton and on it learnt how to use onPressed, then moved the framework of app to Stateful Widget. There use setState when te buttons were pressed. And completed the app.
